                                For the 2020 CFD drive, the Commission chose to support <a className="hover:underline text-blue-450" href="https://www.northwestharvest.org/">NorthWest Harvest</a> 
                                and <a className="hover:underline text-blue-450" href="https://namiseattle.org/">NAMI Seattle</a> during our annual fund drive activities. 
                                In total we collected $4,635! We made a $2,500 donation to NAMI and was also able to provide the equivalent of 9,704 meals with the remaining 
                                $2,135 for NW Harvest. We raised the money by scheduling and coordinating events throughout the year, like a coin derby which was won by MHCF division,  
                                and other offerings like pie baking classes for donation.

                                    and for believing in this important work! 2020 brought us many challenges, 
                                    and we could not have persevered without you. For the last nine months our 
                                    virtual trainings, workshops, presentations, and support groups have been 
                                    instrumental to the stability of so many of our neighbors.
                                    Covid-19, economic recession, social unrest: no one predicted this scenario. 
                                    Yet, NAMI Seattle met the challenge by quickly pivoting all our activities 
                                    and support to an online platform. Our community needed us. 
                                    Our friends and neighbors needed us. And with your help, we delivered!
